# app_extensions

A new Flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Usage

### Date Extensions

To use the date extensions (e.g., `toDateYMD`), you must initialize the date formatting for your desired locale(s) in your `main()` function:

```dart
import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_local.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await initializeDateFormatting('en');
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
